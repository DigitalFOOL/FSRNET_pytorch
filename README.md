# FSRNet Pytorch
Dear friends, 
Thank you for keep tracking in this implementation of FSRNet (CVPR 2018 Oral Paper)

I have been spent the whole summer as an intern in Iluvatar.ai. I have been back to school, so I have time to complete the Project.

I rewrite the Train.py and other model code completely. Now I am uploading pretrained Weights on BaiduNetDisk together with Training Set. 

Based on [WaveletSRNet](https://github.com/hhb072/WaveletSRNet/), I altered the code by adopting FSRNet network structure. 

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.6
* Pytorch 1.0 or newer (Pytorch > 0.4 should be ok)
* matplotlib
* skimage

## Train

Change the option in Train.py to set the dataset's directory. I am using CelebAHQ-MASK as the training set. The GroundTruth is generated by zllrunning/face-parsing.PyTorch(https://github.com/zllrunning/face-parsing.PyTorch) with pretrained model.
